                <h3 id="history-description">Bread is older than metal; even before the bronze age, our ancestors were
                    eating and baking flat breads. There is evidence of neolithic grinding stones used to process
                    grains, probably to make a flat bread; but the oldest bread yet found is a loaf discovered in
                    Switzerland, dating from 3500 BCE. The use of leavening was discovered and recorded by the the
                    Egyptians; there is some discussion about how this process happened, and the degree to which there
                    was an overlap between brewing and bread-making, but obviously without a handy time machine it’s
                    going to remain one a debating point among historians of ancient food. What is not in doubt is that
                    the ancient Egyptians knew both the brewing of beer and the process of baking leavened bread with
                    use of sourdough, as proved by wall paintings and analyses of desiccated bread loves and beer
                    remains (Rothe et al., 1973; Samuel, 1996). <br />

                    Wild yeast is used in cultures all over the world in food preparations that are so seeped in culture
                    and history that they have been made long before any form of written words. The Sudanese, for
                    example make kisra (fermented dough made with sorghum), The Ethiopians use wild yeast to make injera
                    (teff), Mexicans make pool a fermented corn drink, Ghanaian kenkey and Nigerian use fermentation for
                    their maize to make ogi, Indian idli breakfast cakes, made with rice, beans or chickpeas, and the
                    Turkish make bona `( a ferment drink) generally with wheat, maize, sorghum, or millet and Nigerians
                    ferment the cassava to make gari or fufu with. <br />

                    Until the time of the development of commercial yeasts, all leavened bread was made using naturally
                    occurring yeasts – i.e. all bread was sourdough, with it’s slower raise. Indeed, one of the reasons
                    given for the importance of unleavened bread in the Jewish faith is that at the time of the exodus
                    from Egypt, there wasn’t time to let the dough rise overnight.</h3>
