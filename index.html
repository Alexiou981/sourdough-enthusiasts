                <h3 id="history-description">
                    <p>Bread is older than metal; even before the bronze age, our ancestors were
                        eating and baking flat breads. There is evidence of neolithic grinding stones used to process
                        grains, probably to make a flat bread; but the oldest bread yet found is a loaf discovered in
                        Switzerland, dating from 3500 BCE. The use of leavening was discovered and recorded by the the
                        Egyptians; there is some discussion about how this process happened, and the degree to which
                        there
                        was an overlap between brewing and bread-making, but obviously without a handy time machine it’s
                        going to remain one a debating point among historians of ancient food. What is not in doubt is
                        that
                        the ancient Egyptians knew both the brewing of beer and the process of baking leavened bread
                        with
                        use of sourdough, as proved by wall paintings and analyses of desiccated bread loves and beer
                        remains (Rothe et al., 1973; Samuel, 1996).</p> <br />

                    <p>Wild yeast is used in cultures all over the world in food preparations that are so seeped in
                        culture
                        and history that they have been made long before any form of written words. The Sudanese, for
                        example make kisra (fermented dough made with sorghum), The Ethiopians use wild yeast to make
                        injera
                        (teff), Mexicans make pool a fermented corn drink, Ghanaian kenkey and Nigerian use fermentation
                        for
                        their maize to make ogi, Indian idli breakfast cakes, made with rice, beans or chickpeas, and
                        the
                        Turkish make bona `( a ferment drink) generally with wheat, maize, sorghum, or millet and
                        Nigerians
                        ferment the cassava to make gari or fufu with.</p> <br />

                    <p>Until the time of the development of commercial yeasts, all leavened bread was made using
                        naturally
                        occurring yeasts – i.e. all bread was sourdough, with it’s slower raise. Indeed, one of the
                        reasons
                        given for the importance of unleavened bread in the Jewish faith is that at the time of the
                        exodus
                        from Egypt, there wasn’t time to let the dough rise overnight.</p> <br />

                        alt="Interior of peasant's house, a woman making bread"> <br />

                    <p>From Egypt, bread-making also spread north to ancient Greece, where it was a luxury product first
                        produced in the home by women, but later in bakeries; the Greeks had over 70 different types of
                        bread, including both savoury and sweetened loaves, using a number of varieties of grain. The
                        Romans learned the art of bread from the Greeks, making improvements in kneading and baking. The
                        centrality of bread to the Roman diet is shown by Jevenal’s despair that all the population
                        wanted was bread and circuses (panem et circenses). We have sourdough recipes from seventeenth
                        century France using a starter which is fed and risen three times before adding to the dough.
                        The French were obviously far more interested in good tasting bread over an easy life for the
                        baker.</p> <br />

                    <p>The introduction of commercial yeasts in the nineteenth century was to the detriment of sourdough
                        breads, with speed and consistency of production winning. By 1910, Governmental bills preventing
                        night work and restricting hours worked made more labour intensive production less sustainable,
                        and in response, the bakers moved again towards faster raising breads, such as the baguette.
                        It’s only since the nineteen eighties that there has been demand again for sourdoughs in the UK,
                        to the extent that in 1993, regulations were issued defining what could be sold as a sourdough
                        bread. In Germany, again, the use of sourdough was universal until brewers yeasts became common
                        in the fourteen and fifteen hundreds. The overlap between brewing and baking was reflected in
                        monasteries producing both bread and beer, using the heat of the oven to dry malted gain and the
                        yeast to raise the bread. However, the big difference was that in Germany, sourdoughs continued
                        to be used for rye breads, even as bakers’ yeasts became more popular for all other types.</p>

                    <br />

                    <p>While yeast is still used with rye flours, the sourdough is used to increase acidity, which
                        prevents starches from degrading. This use in Germany is also seen in other countries with a
                        strong rye bread tradition; Scandinavian countries and the Baltic states. Like France, the
                        Germans have regulatory protection of what can be sold as sourdough. The prospectors and
                        explorers in the United States in the nineteenth century were referred to as
                        sourdoughs as it was a practice to keep the mother leavening on your person, to make sure it
                        didn’t freeze in the bitter winters. Personally I think that it was to get the yeast’s going,
                        with the warmth so they would be more active and make better bread rather than as a freezing
                        prevention measure. As a result, the bread in San Francisco was predominately sourdough, with
                        bakeries such as the Boudin Bakery still baking today after having been founded in the mid
                        nineteenth century.</p> <br />

                    <br />

                    <p>Here in the UK, greater and earlier urbanisation, and the later invention of the Chorleywood
                        process enabling the mass production of bread using softer English wheats moved baking away from
                        small scale and artisanal production towards larger industrial methods. However, with the
                        current triumph of television baking, and a re-invigoration of interest in the quality of the
                        food we eat after the nadir of the post war period, interest in sourdoughs from smaller bakeries
                        and home production is once again on the rise.</p>

                    Sourdough bread is a fermented food that people around the world have eaten for thousands of
                    years. Manufacturers make it using a starter culture with yeasts and bacteria. These microbes ferment
                    the carbohydrates in the flour, producing carbon dioxide gas that makes the bread rise. 
                    Sourdough is a traditional leavened bread, so it takes longer to ferment than regular bread and
                    has a tart flavor and unique texture. Leavening is the process of using a raising agent to make
                    bread rise. To make regular bread, manufacturers use commercial baker’s yeast.
                </h3> <br />
                <h2>Easy to Digest</h2> <br />
                <h3>
                    The fermentation process that manufacturers use to make sourdough bread means that the food may be 
                    easier to digest than some other types, particularly for people with digestive issues.
                    A laboratory studyTrusted Source using stool samples from donors with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) suggested 
                    that sourdough bread was less likely to lead to IBS symptoms than unfermented bread.
                    The researchers suggested that sourdough bread enhances the growth of beneficial bacteria 
                    rather than undesirable microorganisms. Sourdough bread’s long fermentation times may cause less gas and bloating 
                    than regular wheat bread. A 2018 study suggested that sourdough bread may reduce fermentable oligosaccharides, 
                    disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols (FODMAPs). FODMAPS can cause symptoms in people with IBS. 
                    The study indicated that sourdough bread may also reduce abdominal pain and flatulence and improve the gut’s microbiota.
                </h3> <br />
                <h2>Low phytate content</h2> <br />
                <h3> 
                    Some research from 2005 suggested that the sourdough fermentation process can lower the phytate content trusted source of whole wheat flour. 
                    Phytates are plant compounds that can inhibit the absorption of essential nutrients in the body.
                    The review indicated that the phytic acid degradation in sourdough bread increases the bioavailability of minerals, free amino acids, and protein.
                </h3> <br />
                <h2>Increased phytochemicals</h2> <br />
                <h3>
                    The fermentation process of sourdough bread reduces anti-nutrients such as phytates in humans and monogastric animals, and it increases beneficial phytochemicals.
                    Some researchTrusted Source has indicated that sourdough bread has more phenols, carotenoids, folates, and other beneficial compounds than unfermented bread.
                    Many of the plant compounds present in sourdough bread have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, which can benefit health.
